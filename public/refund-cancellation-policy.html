    <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made immediately after placing the order. However, the cancellation request may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to the vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of shipping them.</li>
      <li>ANUBHAV GUPTA does not accept cancellation requests for perishable items like flowers, eatables etc.</li>
      <li>In case of complaints regarding products that come with a warranty from manufacturers, please refer the issue to them.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
